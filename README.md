Local Storage

The project is a tweet list application that allows users to enter tweets and display them in a list. It uses browser local storage to persistently store the tweets. The workflow is as follows:

1- The user enters the content of a tweet in a text field and clicks the "Add" button.
2- Validation is performed to ensure that the text field is not empty.
3- A tweet object is created with a unique identifier and the entered content.
4- The tweet is added to a list of tweets.
5- The updated list of tweets is displayed on the page.
6- Each tweet in the list has a associated "Delete" button.
7- Clicking the "Delete" button displays a confirmation popup.
8 -If the user confirms the deletion, the tweet is removed from the list.
9- Changes are saved to the browser's local storage for persistent storage.
10- The list of tweets is updated on the page after adding or deleting a tweet.
In summary, the project allows users to enter tweets, display them in a list, and delete them if needed. The tweets are stored in the browser's local storage for persistence between sessions. This provides basic functionality for managing a simple tweet list.
